    <h1>Sulfur/Mercury v0.1a Level tutorial</h1>
    Make sure you have Mercury installed from whatever source. (If rbxmx, go to PLUGINS tab, Open Plugins Folder, and place it there)
    <br>
    <p>
        First, open a new place file, and empty the Workspace. <br> <br>

        Then, go to your PLUGINS tab and click on Toggle Mercury GUI.
        Unlike CSEdit, Mercury uses a bunch of windows for everything, so make sure you have them enabled. <br> <br> 

        On "Mercury - Main", click "Load Template". This will place the correct mod structure inside of game.ReplicatedStorage. <br> 
        This template contains a level template as well. You can delete it if you want your mod to only use scripts, but for this tutorial, we need it. <br> <br>

        Take the template out to Workspace to edit it. Make sure NO OTHER Folders exist in Workspace, as it will confuse Mercury. <br>
        From there on, you can change level settings in Level.Configuration (TODO:: create music list), and place Objects using "Mercury - Objects". <br>
        Once you highlight an object, you can view it's properties in the same "Mercury - Objects" window (Click on "Selected Object Properties" if they don't appear.) <br> <br>

        Once you're done, drag the level back to "game.ReplicatedStorage.Mod.Maps", and click "Export Mod" in "Mercury - Main".
        You can then load this mod via the "MODS" tab in-game.

        <p>
            To define custom objects, go to "Mod.EditorDefinitions", and copy the existing Red Star Ring code, <b>MAKING SURE TO KEEP THE ; AFTER THE }</b> <br> <br>
            <img src="images/editordef.png"> <br> <br>
            After this, make sure to click "Update object definitions". <br>
            you'll need to load the object via the addObject() function, as well as define any custom behaviour.
            You can use the "RedStarRing" script in "Mod.Scripts" for reference. <br>
